# OCR-Implementation.

*This repo implements a classifier and a detector for Optical Character Recognition.
*chars74k-lite dataset has been used for this implementation.
*The repo contains dataset_explore.py to load the dataset,
*feature_engineering.py to explore some of the feature engineering techniques like PCA, guassian filter, HOG
*visualise.py for visualization
*classifier.py has the implementation of classifier with different classification algorithms
*detector.py has the code for detector with sliding window. 

To run this you have to download the dataset chars74k-lite.

Different classic Machine learning algorithms are implemented with confusion matrix.
*SVM
*KNN
*Logistic regression
*Random forest.
